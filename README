#mmb - fork
This is a fork from the older original to make it more useful to my purposes.


##Initial commits:
* Get rid of pyMedia, it's outdated as all get out.
* Switch input to a FIFO buffer (feed from mpg123)
* Add arguments/commandline-ability


##Building
Looks like to get this going you must do two things:
###celt
Go in to the celt folder and run
`python ./setup.py build`
and copy the build *.so file to the main directory (you have to dig down in to the build folder).
###libcryptstate
Go in to the libcryptstate folder and run
`make` (simple, duh)
and copy the *.so file to the main directory.

From there it should all work.

##Running
`python ./main.py`
There's help in there so read that, it'll be kept more up to date.
